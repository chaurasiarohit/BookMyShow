	<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
	<p>Arthur Fleck, a man struggling with loneliness and isolation, wears two masks. One, he paints on for his day job as a clown. The other is a guise he projects in an attempt to find his place in Gotham City`s fractured society. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur begins to make one bad decision after another. What follows is a new take on the origin story of one of cinema`s most iconic villains.</p>
